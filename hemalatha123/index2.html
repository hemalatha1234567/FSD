<h2> About HER</h2>
        <Li> sneha is the first person who comes to mind in any critical emergency. 
          Whenever I’m having difficulty, my friend assists me in getting out of it by offering the most simple solutions. 
          My friend understands and guides me when 
          I make a mistake and congratulates me when I achieve something.

          They encourage me to improve as a person. 
          We plan our weekends together and enjoy them to the fullest. 
          My best friend makes me happy and deserves all my love and attention.
           My acquaintance has served as a support system and a source of strength.
          
          Friendship may be a huge help in anyone’s life. Throughout one’s life
          , one comes into contact with various people. 
          We find those who share our viewpoints and comparable tastes and personalities.
           We grow closer to such people and spend more time with them.
          
          Gradually, some form of bond emerges, which lasts a lifetime in the case of lucky friendships
          , or exists for some time, during which it is a positive and comforting experience.
           Friends are more or less family for many people. There will be many things in common between you and your buddies.</Li>
